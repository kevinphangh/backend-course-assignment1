## 3. Web API Code Pitch (1 minute)

### Live Demonstration
```bash
# Running the endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/menu

# Expected response:
[
  {"name": "Group42", "price": 75},
  {"name": "Spaghetti Carbonara", "price": 89},
  {"name": "Caesar Salad", "price": 65}
]
```

### Q: Where is the code for the endpoint?

**Controller Location:** `src/WebAPI/Controllers/MenuController.cs`

**Detailed Code Structure:**
- **Lines 1-3:** Using statements
- **Lines 4-43:** Complete controller implementation
- **Line 9:** `[ApiController]` attribute for automatic model validation
- **Line 10:** `[Route("api/[controller]")]` sets route to `/api/menu`
- **Line 11:** Controller class declaration inheriting from `ControllerBase`
- **Lines 15-32:** Private field `_dishes` with hardcoded data
- **Lines 37-41:** GET endpoint method implementation

**Key implementation details:**
```csharp
[HttpGet]  // Line 37
public ActionResult<IEnumerable<Dish>> Menu()  // Line 38
{
    return Ok(_dishes);  // Line 40 - Returns 200 OK with JSON
}
```

### Q: Explain the data flow from the calling of the endpoint

**Complete Request/Response Flow:**

1. **Client initiates request** → `GET http://localhost:8080/api/menu`

2. **Kestrel Web Server** (Line in Program.cs: `builder.WebHost.UseKestrel()`)
   - Receives HTTP request on port 8080
   - Passes to ASP.NET Core pipeline

3. **Middleware Pipeline** (Program.cs lines 13-15)
   - Request logging (if enabled)
   - Exception handling middleware
   - HTTPS redirection (in production)
   - Routing middleware matches URL pattern

4. **Route Matching**
   - Pattern `/api/[controller]` matches `/api/menu`
   - Controller name "Menu" extracted from `MenuController`
   - HTTP verb GET matches `[HttpGet]` attribute

5. **Controller Instantiation**
   - DI container creates new `MenuController` instance
   - No constructor dependencies needed (simple controller)

6. **Method Execution** (Lines 38-40)
   - `Menu()` method invoked
   - Accesses `_dishes` field (lines 15-32)
   - First dish "Group42" fulfills assignment requirement

7. **Response Generation**
   - `Ok()` helper creates `OkObjectResult`
   - Status code set to 200
   - Content-Type set to `application/json`

8. **JSON Serialization**
   - System.Text.Json serializes `List<Dish>`
   - Nullable integers handled properly
   - PascalCase converted to camelCase

9. **Response Pipeline**
   - Response flows back through middleware
   - Headers added (CORS if configured)
   - Response sent to client

### Additional Q&A Scenarios

**Q: What is an endpoint?**
An endpoint is a specific URL pattern combined with an HTTP method that the API exposes for clients to interact with. In my implementation, `/api/menu` with GET method is an endpoint that returns the list of available dishes.

**Q: How would you add authentication to this endpoint?**
I would add the `[Authorize]` attribute above the controller or method, configure JWT authentication in Program.cs, and add authentication middleware to the pipeline.

**Q: Why use ControllerBase instead of Controller?**
`ControllerBase` is for APIs - it doesn't include View support that `Controller` has. Since this is a pure Web API project, I use `ControllerBase` for a lighter base class.

## 4. Dockerfile Pitch (1 minute)

### Multi-Stage Build Architecture

I implemented a sophisticated multi-stage Dockerfile to optimize both build time and final image size:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build Stage (Lines 5-14)
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["WebAPI.csproj", "./"]
RUN dotnet restore "WebAPI.csproj"
COPY . .
RUN dotnet build "WebAPI.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

# Stage 2: Publish Stage (Lines 17-18)
FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "WebAPI.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish /p:UseAppHost=false

# Stage 3: Runtime Stage (Lines 21-37)
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS final
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "WebAPI.dll"]
```

### Q: What services did you define in your docker file?

**Not services, but stages - important distinction:**

1. **Build Stage** (`build`) - Development environment
   - Base image: `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0` (~800MB)
   - Contains: Full .NET SDK, MSBuild, NuGet
   - Purpose: Compile source code to binaries

2. **Publish Stage** (`publish`) - Optimization layer
   - Extends: Build stage
   - Purpose: Create release-optimized, trimmed binaries
   - Removes: Debug symbols, unused dependencies

3. **Final Stage** (`final`) - Production runtime
   - Base image: `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0` (~200MB)
   - Contains: Only .NET runtime, no SDK
   - Purpose: Minimal attack surface, fast startup

### Q: What is the meaning of specific lines in the docker file?

**Line-by-Line Analysis:**

**Line 7 - WORKDIR /src**
- Creates and sets `/src` as working directory
- All subsequent commands run from this location
- Provides consistent paths regardless of host OS

**Line 11 - COPY ["WebAPI.csproj", "./"]**
- Copies ONLY project file first
- Enables Docker layer caching optimization
- If dependencies unchanged, skips restore on rebuild
- Bracket syntax handles spaces in filenames

**Line 12 - RUN dotnet restore**
- Downloads NuGet packages specified in csproj
- Creates separate cacheable layer
- Network-intensive operation isolated

**Line 16 - RUN dotnet build -c Release**
- Compiles in Release configuration
- Optimizations enabled, debug info excluded
- Output to `/app/build` directory

**Line 21 - RUN dotnet publish**
- Creates deployment-ready package
- `/p:UseAppHost=false` - Uses framework-dependent deployment
- Reduces size, relies on runtime in container

**Line 29 - EXPOSE 8080**
- Documents container listens on port 8080
- Doesn't actually open port (that's docker run -p)
- Metadata for orchestrators and documentation

**Line 32 - COPY --from=publish**
- Copies ONLY published files from build stage
- Build artifacts stay in build stage (never shipped)
- Dramatically reduces final image size

**Line 36 - ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS**
- Configures Kestrel to bind to all interfaces (+)
- Required for container networking
- Without this, would only listen on localhost

**Line 39 - ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "WebAPI.dll"]**
- Exec form (not shell form) for proper signal handling
- PID 1 process receives Docker stop signals correctly
- Starts application when container launches

### Q: What is port mapping?

Port mapping connects a port on the host machine to a port inside the container. In docker-compose.yml line 34, `"8080:8080"` maps host port 8080 to container port 8080. This allows external access to the containerized API.

### Q: How is this different from using the SDK image directly?

Using SDK image directly would result in:
- 800MB image vs 200MB with multi-stage
- Security vulnerabilities from build tools in production
- Slower container startup
- Unnecessary attack surface

### Docker Compose Integration

**docker-compose.yml orchestration:**

```yaml
services:
  sqlserver:
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
    environment:
      - MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=YourStrong@Passw0rd123
    healthcheck:  # Ensures DB ready before API starts
      test: ["CMD", "/opt/mssql-tools18/bin/sqlcmd", "-S", "localhost", "-U", "sa", "-P", "YourStrong@Passw0rd123", "-C", "-Q", "SELECT 1"]

  webapi:
    image: kevinphangh/local-food-api:latest  # Pulls from Docker Hub
    depends_on:
      sqlserver:
        condition: service_healthy  # Waits for healthcheck
```

**Key Docker Compose features I utilized:**
- Health checks ensure proper startup order
- Named volumes persist SQL data
- Bridge network for container communication
- Environment variables for configuration

## 5. E/R Design Pitch (1 minute)

### Chen Notation Compliance

I strictly followed Chen notation requirements:
- **Rectangles** for entities (Cook, Customer, Cyclist, etc.)
- **Diamonds** for relationships (Offers, Places, Delivers, etc.)
- **Ovals** for attributes (shown in simplified diagram)
- **Lines** with cardinality markers (1, N, M)

### Q: What works best and worst in this diagram?

**Best Design Decisions:**

1. **Clean Actor Separation**
   - Three distinct user types: Cook, Cyclist, Customer
   - No inheritance complexity, simple to query
   - Each has specific required fields per assignment

2. **TIME Datatype for Availability**
   - Portions have `AvailableFrom` and `AvailableUntil`
   - Recurring daily windows without date complexity
   - Efficient queries for "what's available now"

3. **TripStop Pattern**
   - Elegant solution for multi-delivery trips
   - One Trip → Many TripStops → Individual Orders
   - Supports Star's requirement for route optimization
   - StopOrder field maintains delivery sequence

4. **Separated Ratings**
   - FoodRating and DeliveryRating in same table
   - Can rate food without delivery (takeout scenario)
   - Can rate delivery without food (complaint scenario)

**Challenging Aspects:**

1. **Nullable Ratings**
   - Ratings come after delivery completion
   - Required nullable columns in Rating table
   - Need careful NULL handling in AVG calculations

2. **Order-to-Cook Relationship**
   - OrderItem needs both OrderID and CookID
   - Enables multi-kitchen orders but adds complexity
   - Requires additional JOIN for full order details

### Q: What part of the diagram was more difficult to achieve?

**Most Challenging: The Trip Delivery System**

Initial attempts failed because I tried:
1. Direct Trip → Order relationship (didn't support multiple orders)
2. Many-to-many with junction table (lost stop sequence)
3. Embedded stop data in Trip (violated normalization)

**Final Solution:**
```
Trip (1) ─── has ──→ (N) TripStop (N) ←── for ─── (1) Order
```

This preserves:
- Stop sequence (StopOrder column)
- Multiple stops per trip
- One order per stop
- Pickup and delivery differentiation

### Q: Why is this relation a many-to-many?

**Cook-to-Portion: One-to-Many (1:N)**
- One cook offers many portions
- Each portion belongs to exactly one cook
- Example: Noah's Kitchen offers 10 different dishes
- Business rule: Cooks own their recipes exclusively

**Order-to-Portion: Many-to-Many (M:N)**
- One order can contain multiple portions
- One portion type appears in multiple orders
- Implemented via OrderItem junction table
- OrderItem adds: Quantity, SubtotalPrice

**Why junction table for Order-Portion?**
```sql
OrderItem table:
- OrderID (FK to Order)
- PortionID (FK to Portion)
- CookID (FK to Cook)
- Quantity (additional attribute)
- SubtotalPrice (calculated field)
```

### Q: How are tables related (foreign keys)?

**Primary Foreign Key Relationships:**

1. **Portion.CookID → Cook.CookID**
   - CASCADE DELETE: Cook deletion removes their portions
   - Ensures data integrity

2. **Order.CustomerID → Customer.CustomerID**
   - CASCADE DELETE: Customer deletion removes orders
   - GDPR compliance capability

3. **OrderItem.OrderID → Order.OrderID**
   - CASCADE DELETE: Order deletion removes items
   - Maintains referential integrity

4. **OrderItem.PortionID → Portion.PortionID**
   - NO CASCADE: Portion deletion prevented if ordered
   - Preserves historical order data

5. **Trip.CyclistID → Cyclist.CyclistID**
   - NO CASCADE: Cyclist can't be deleted with trips
   - Maintains delivery history

6. **TripStop.TripID → Trip.TripID**
   - CASCADE DELETE: Trip deletion removes stops
   - Atomic trip management

7. **TripStop.OrderID → Order.OrderID**
   - NO CASCADE: Order preservation required
   - Audit trail maintenance

8. **Rating.CustomerID → Customer.CustomerID**
   - SET NULL: Customer deletion preserves ratings
   - Anonymous feedback possible

9. **Rating.CookID → Cook.CookID**
   - SET NULL: Cook deletion preserves ratings
   - Historical rating data retained

### Entity Cardinalities

**Complete Cardinality Map:**

- Cook (1) ──offers──→ (N) Portion
- Customer (1) ──places──→ (N) Order
- Order (1) ──contains──→ (N) OrderItem
- OrderItem (N) ←──of──→ (1) Portion
- Cyclist (1) ──makes──→ (N) Trip
- Trip (1) ──has──→ (N) TripStop
- TripStop (N) ←──for──→ (1) Order
- Customer (1) ──gives──→ (N) Rating
- Rating (N) ←──about──→ (1) Cook
- Rating (N) ←──about──→ (1) Cyclist

-- Validates: Only 'Card' or 'MobilePay' allowed
```

**Portion Availability Check:**
```sql
SELECT Name, AvailableFrom, AvailableUntil
FROM dbo.Portion
WHERE CAST(GETDATE() AS TIME) BETWEEN AvailableFrom AND AvailableUntil;
-- Returns currently available portions
```

---

## 7. Design Decisions and Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Design Philosophy

**Normalization Level:** 3NF (Third Normal Form)
- No repeating groups (1NF)
- No partial dependencies (2NF)
- No transitive dependencies (3NF)
- Avoided BCNF for query performance

**Identity Configuration:**
```sql
-- Special 0-based seeding for assignment requirements
DBCC CHECKIDENT ('dbo.Cook', RESEED, 0);
DBCC CHECKIDENT ('dbo.Order', RESEED, 0);
-- Enables Order #42 = ID 0, Trip #52 = ID 0
```

### Key Technical Decisions

**1. TIME vs DATETIME for Availability**
- Chose TIME for recurring daily windows
- Avoids date management complexity
- Efficient BETWEEN queries
- Storage: 3-5 bytes vs 8 bytes

**2. Cascade Delete Strategy**
```sql
-- Cascading deletes for data ownership
Cook → Portion (CASCADE)
Customer → Order (CASCADE)

-- No cascade for audit trail
Portion → OrderItem (RESTRICT)
Cyclist → Trip (RESTRICT)
```

**3. Rating System Design**
- Single table with nullable columns
- Allows partial ratings
- Simplifies queries
- Supports future rating types

**4. Price Storage**
- Used INT for prices (Danish Øre)
- Avoids floating-point issues
- 7500 = 75.00 DKK
- Consistent with payment systems

### Docker Architecture Decisions

**Why Multi-Stage Build?**
- Security: No build tools in production
- Size: 200MB vs 800MB image
- Cache: Optimized layer reuse
- Speed: Faster container startup

**Why Docker Compose?**
- Service orchestration
- Health check dependencies
- Environment configuration
- Volume management
- Network isolation

**Why Docker Hub?**
- Part C requirement
- Public accessibility
- Automated builds possible
- Version tagging support

### API Design Choices

**Why Hardcoded Data?**
- Assignment specifically requires it
- Demonstrates API structure
- No database dependency for Part A
- Simple to validate "Group42" requirement

**Why Minimal API Approach?**
- Reduced boilerplate
- Faster startup
- Smaller memory footprint
- Modern .NET 8 pattern

### Security Considerations

**Implemented:**
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- Container isolation
- Non-root container user
- Environment variable configuration

**Production Additions Needed:**
- JWT authentication
- HTTPS enforcement
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- CORS configuration

- Represented as M:N relationship properly

❌ **Did NOT use SDK image in production**
- Multi-stage build with runtime-only final image
- Security and size optimized

❌ **Did NOT forget cardinalities**
- Every relationship has 1, N, or M markers
- Clear crow's foot notation where applicable

❌ **Did NOT have incorrect query outputs**
- Column counts match requirements
- TIME formatting correct
- NULL handling proper

### Potential Questions I'm Prepared For:

**"What is a foreign key?"**
A foreign key is a column that references the primary key of another table, establishing a relationship between tables and enforcing referential integrity. For example, `Portion.CookID` references `Cook.CookID`.

**"Explain the difference between 1:N and M:N"**
1:N means one record in the first table relates to many in the second (Cook→Portions). M:N means many records in both tables can relate to each other, requiring a junction table (Order↔Portion via OrderItem).

**"Why use Docker Compose?"**
Docker Compose orchestrates multiple containers (API + Database), manages dependencies with health checks, provides networking between containers, and persists data with volumes.

**"What does EXPOSE do in Dockerfile?"**
EXPOSE documents which port the container listens on. It doesn't actually open the port - that's done with `-p` flag or ports in docker-compose.yml. It's metadata for documentation and orchestrators.

**"Why nullable price in Dish model?"**
The nullable integer allows dishes without set prices (market price, special offers). The assignment didn't mandate prices, so I made it flexible while still meeting the "Group42" requirement.

### Confidence Statement

I'm fully confident in defending every aspect of this solution. The implementation meets all assignment requirements, follows best practices, and demonstrates deep understanding of:
- ASP.NET Core Web API development
- Docker containerization and orchestration
- Relational database design with Chen notation
- SQL query construction and optimization
- Software architecture principles

The solution is production-ready with minor additions (authentication, HTTPS) and showcases professional-grade development practices expected in the SW4BAD course.
